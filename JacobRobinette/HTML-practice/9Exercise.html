    <p>
      The body odors of men and women <strong>smell different</strong>.<br>

      The natural scent of men's body odor is more like <em>rotten cheese</em>.<br>
      Women wear sweet purfume because it's close to their natural scents,<br>
      whereas men wear muskier scents because they're closer to their natural odors.
